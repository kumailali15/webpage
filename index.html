            <p>
                Electric bikes, also known as EV bikes, are becoming one of the most popular modes of transport in the modern world. They run on rechargeable batteries instead of petrol or diesel. This makes them eco-friendly and reduces air pollution. EV bikes are very
                quiet while riding, which also lowers noise pollution in cities. They are cheaper to maintain compared to traditional motorcycles. Charging an EV bike costs much less than filling a fuel tank. Many EV bikes can travel 70â€“150 kilometers
                on a single charge. Some advanced models even go beyond 200 kilometers. They are lightweight and easy to ride for daily use. Governments in many countries promote EV bikes with subsidies and tax benefits. Another benefit is that EV bikes
                produce zero carbon emissions. This helps fight global warming and climate change. EV bikes come in stylish designs to attract young riders. They are also safe, as the speed is usually controlled and limited. Most EV bikes can be charged
                at home using a simple socket. Fast charging stations are also being set up in cities. The demand for EV bikes is increasing every year. They are a perfect solution for short city rides. In the future, EV bikes may completely replace petrol
                bikes. Overall, EV bikes represent the future of clean and smart transportation.
